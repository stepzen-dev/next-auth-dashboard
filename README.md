Stump-a-Stepr Challenge: Creating Event Form and Search functionality for Application Distribution.

If you have a challenge for StepZen to solve, sign up on our discord and send our team a challenge! https://discord.com/invite/9k2VdPn2FR

This challenge was to find a way to combine the previous data of a person and shorten the length of each form based on the user logging in for an event.

Takeaways from this challenge:
- Creating an @rest endpoint with type definition for form fields.
- Combining @rest endpoints with @materializer to create search functionality of a user events and enable progressive profiling.
- Routing a user in NextJS to a unique form based on the information not yet provided that is needed for the specific event.

Details of the series:
Developers sent GraphQL challenges to the StepZen team that to solve in this livestream series.  An example of a challenge would be linking two different APIs together using the StepZen @materializer directive.
