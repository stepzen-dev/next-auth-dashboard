# next-auth-dashboard

If you have a challenge for StepZen to solve, sign up on our discord and send our team a challenge! https://discord.com/invite/9k2VdPn2FR
This challenge finds a way to have a logged-in event organizer discover all historical events and event attendees.

Takeaways from this challenge:
- Creating a NextJS Auth that checks with an organizer database to see a user can access the dashboard.
- Creating an @rest endpoint that queries the logged-in event organizer, the associated events, and the associated attendees to each event in a dashboard.
- Associate an event organizer with existing events or a newly created event that has been created by the logged-in event organizer.

Details of the series:
Developers sent GraphQL challenges to the StepZen team that to solve in this livestream series.  An example of a challenge would be linking two different APIs together using the StepZen @materializer directive.
